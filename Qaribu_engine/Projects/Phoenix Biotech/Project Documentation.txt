# Project Documentation for Phoenix Biotech Analysis Dashboards and Trend Analysis Models  
   
## 1. Introduction  
   
This document outlines the project plan for developing analysis dashboards and trend analysis models for Phoenix Biotech. The goal of this project is to offer enhanced data visualization and analysis capabilities, aiding in more informed decision-making processes.  
   
## 2. Project Overview  
   
The project involves the design and development of interactive analysis dashboards and predictive trend analysis models. These tools will enable Phoenix Biotech to efficiently process and analyze their vast amounts of data, identify meaningful trends, and make data-driven business decisions.  
   
## 3. Technologies in Use  
   
- **Data Visualization Tool**: Tableau is chosen for its powerful dashboard capabilities, providing interactive and visually appealing data representations.  
- **Data Analysis**: Python, specifically libraries like Pandas and NumPy, will be used for data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, a Python library, will be used to develop trend analysis models.  
- **Database**: MySQL will be used to manage and store data securely.  
- **Server**: AWS will be used for hosting the application due to its robust and scalable infrastructure.  
- **Version Control**: Git will be used for version control, allowing for effective collaboration and tracking of changes.
